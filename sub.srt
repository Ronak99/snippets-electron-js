WEBVTT

00:00:01.971 --> 00:00:04.672
We're quite<br> content to be the 2500 odd<br>browser out.

00:00:05.302 --> 00:00:08.958
We don't have a fancy stock abbreviation <br>to go alongside our name in the press.

00:00:09.526 --> 00:00:11.324
We don't have a profit margin.

00:00:11.413 --> 00:00:13.979
We don't have sacred rock stars<br>that we put above others.

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:16.913
We don't make the same deals,<br>sign the same contracts.

00:00:17.227 --> 00:00:19.789
Or shake the same hands,<br>as everyone else.

00:00:20.568 --> 00:00:22.568
And all this... is fine by us.

00:00:23.437 --> 00:00:27.065
Were are a pack of independently, spirited, <br>fiercely unconventional people,

00:00:27.145 --> 00:00:29.145
who do things a little differently.

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:31.810
Where another company may value<br>the bottom line...

00:00:32.283 --> 00:00:34.583
We value... well, values.

00:00:35.644 --> 00:00:38.012
When a competitor considers <br>to make something propriertary.

00:00:38.642 --> 00:00:40.642
We strive to set it free.

00:00:40.929 --> 00:00:44.556
And while most products and technologies <br>are developed behind closed doors.

00:00:44.886 --> 00:00:46.606
Ours are cultivated out in the open.

00:00:46.651 --> 00:00:48.525
For everyone to see.
